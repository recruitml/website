					<h4>Tim Wolfenden<br><em>CEO</em></h4>
					<p>“Having in-house recruiters is an expensive fixed cost and there is a lot of downtime when we aren’t recruiting. RecruitML presented such a clear cost advantage over doing it ourselves that we outsourced our entire recruitment work to RecruitML.  We haven’t had a bad hire yet and we now focus on the important task of developing our people and our culture.”</p>

					<h4>Joanna Simmons<br><em>HR Manager</em></h4>
					<p>“RecruitML removed the distraction of assessing whether a candidate can do the job. We know the candidates RecruitML sends us can do the job and we can see their work prior to meeting them.  Now our interviews are simply ‘Do we want to work with this person for the next few years?’.  Our hiring success is at 100% now.  Thanks RecruitML, you’ve changed our business”</p>
